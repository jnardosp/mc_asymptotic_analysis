    "An Birth-Death Process is a special case of continuous-time Markov process where the state transitions are of only 2 types \"births\" (increasing the state var by 1), and \"deaths\" (decreasing state by one).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we would have a discrete-time, finite-state BDP; or also a Nearest-Neighbor Random Walk (we will also see what happens when the walk is biased ($p\\neq q$).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we would like to prove that the stationary distribution $\\pi$ must satisfy the Detailed Balance property ($\\pi_{j}P_{ij}= \\pi_{j}P_{ji}$)."
