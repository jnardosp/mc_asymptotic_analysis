    "## Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "An Birth-Death Process is a special case of continuous-time Markov process where the state transitions are of only 2 types \"births\" (increasing the state var by 1), and \"deaths\" (decreasing state by one).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Markov Chain nxn transition matrix $P$ looks like this:\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "q & p & 0 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n",
    "q & 0 & p & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & q & 0 & p & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & q & 0 & \\ddots & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & p \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & q & p\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "In this case we would have a discrete-time, finite-state BDP; or also a Nearest-Neighbor Random Walk (we will also see what happens when the walk is biased ($p\\neq q$).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we would like to prove that the stationary distribution $\\pi$ must satisfy the Detailed Balance property ($\\pi_{j}P_{ij}= \\pi_{j}P_{ji}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $\\pi$ stationary distribution of $P$ transition matrix, because $\\pi$ is stationary we have that is invariant over P so:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\pi_{j}P_{ji}=\\pi_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our $P$ matrix is tridiagonal and $P_{ii}=0$ for all $i\\neq 1,n$ we would have for internal states:\n",
    "$$\\pi_{i}=\\pi_{i-1}P_{i-1,i}+\\pi_{i+1,i}P_{i+1,i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using that $P_{i-1,i}=p$ and $P_{i+1,i}=q$:\n",
    "$$\\pi_{i}=\\pi_{i-1}p+\\pi_{i+1,i}q$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have that the row sum for all internal states is 1 so $P_{i,i-1}+P_{i,i+1}=1$:\n",
    "$$\\pi_{i}(P_{i,i-1}+P_{i,i+1})=\\pi_{i-1}p+\\pi_{i+1,i}q$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We rearrange the terms to see the probability flow between adjacent boundaries:\n",
    "$$\\pi_{i}P_{i,i-1}-\\pi_{i-1}P_{i-1,i}=\\pi_{i+1,i}P_{i+1,i}-\\pi_{i}P_{i,i+1}$$\n",
    "So in the left side of the equation we have the flow left out of i into i-1, and in the right side the flow left out of i+1 into i.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have that the net probability flux between any pair of states (i-1,i) is constant across all the internal stats:\n",
    "$$\\pi_{i}q-\\pi_{i-1}p=C (\\text{for } 2 \\leq i \\leq N-1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For ($i=1$) we have:\n",
    "$$\\pi_1 = \\pi_1 P_{1, 1} + \\pi_2 P_{2, 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $P_{1,1}=q$ and $P_{2,1}=q$:\n",
    "$$\\pi_1 = \\pi_1 q + \\pi_2 q$$\n",
    "$$\\pi_2 q = \\pi_1 (1 - q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $p+q=1$, $1-q=p$:\n",
    "$$\\pi_2 q = \\pi_1 p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have Detailed balance between state 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ($i=N$) we will have:\n",
    "$$\\pi_N = \\pi_{N-1} P_{N-1, N} + \\pi_N P_{N, N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $P_{N-1, N}=p$ and $P_{N, N}=p$:\n",
    "$$\\pi_N = \\pi_{N-1} p + \\pi_N p$$\n",
    "$$\\pi_{N-1} p = \\pi_N (1 - p)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $1-p=q$:\n",
    "$$\\pi_{N-1} p = \\pi_N q$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have Detailed balance between state N-1 and N.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the flux C is constant through the chain it must be 0 everywhere so:\n",
    "$$\\pi_{i}q-\\pi_{i-1}p=C \\Longrightarrow \\pi_{i}q=\\pi_{i-1}p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So our chain has Detailed balance and is reversible.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Actually we would also have this because the BDP was irreducible xdn't)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculate stationary distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that our chain has Detail Balance and is reversible we simply have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi_{i}=\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)\\pi_{i-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the structure of the components of $\\pi$ recursively with the bias ratio $r=\\frac{p}{q}$:\n",
    "| State $i$ | Relation to $\\pi_{i-1}$ | Relation to $\\pi_1$ |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :--- |\n",

    "| $N$ | $\\pi_N = r \\cdot \\pi_{N-1}$ | $\\pi_N = r^{N-1} \\pi_1$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "We have this geometric sequence $(1, r, r^2, \\dots, r^{N-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\pi$ is a probability distribution the sum of all the components must be 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^N \\pi_{i} = \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\dots + \\pi_{N} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can substitute with the sequence we found earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi_{1} (1 + r + r^2 + \\dots + r^{N-1}) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence we found is a finite geometric series that is:\n",
    "$$1+r+r^2 + \\cdots + r^{N-1} = \\frac{r^{N} - 1}{r-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So finally we have that:\n",
    "$$\\pi_{1} = \\frac{r-1}{r^{N} - 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We have 2 important cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unbiased Walk (so p=q and r=1):\n",
    "\n",
    "We have that r=1 so the series sum is $1+1+\\dots+1=N$\n",

    "\n",
    "Since $\\pi_{i} = 1^{i-1} \\pi_{1}$, all components are equal.$$\\pi_{i} = \\frac{1}{N}$$\n",
